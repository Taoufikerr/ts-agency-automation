# TS Agency — Async Automation Service

I run **TS Agency**, an async automation service.  
We help founders, freelancers, and teams eliminate repetitive work and save hours every week — 100% async, no calls, no meetings.

## 🚀 What I Do
- Design and build automation workflows using **n8n**
- Summarize client inputs with **Groq LLM**
- Deliver clear automation briefs in **Notion**
- Track operations in **Google Sheets**
- Send async updates via **email and Slack**

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- n8n (workflow orchestration)
- Groq Mixtral (LLM)
- Notion API
- Google Sheets API
- SMTP / Brevo

## 📈 What Clients Get
- An automation brief (summary + next steps) within 24h  
- Done-for-you workflows (custom, async delivery)  
- Custom systems for teams that need advanced integrations
